I had the pleasure to be invited by [David
Catuhe][1] to participate in a round table about
Windows8 development during [Microsoft TechDays
2013][2]!

I was joined by [Christopher Maneu][3] from Deezer and
[Guillaume Leborgne][4] from
MCNext, both deeply involved in Windows development. David (cropped from the
photo) led the discussion with [Jean Ferré][5], who
leads the developers, platform and ecosystem division at Microsoft France.

The discussion was very interesting and openly addressed the late start of
Microsoft on mobile. They seem to have spared no effort to ease the work of
developers, for example by opening the platform to development in
HTML5/Javascript. I confess I initially thought it was a strange choice for
native apps but it seems to have attracted quite a few web developers.

This round table was a great opportunity to meet smart people and gain insight
into the Microsoft platform! Thanks also to the journalists in attendance who
covered Algolia in the IT press.
